# Task 3 - Matrix Operations Tool (NumPy)

## Project Description
This project is a Matrix Operations Tool built using Python and NumPy.
It provides an interactive GUI using Tkinter that allows users to input two matrices and perform:

- Addition (A + B)
- Subtraction (A - B)
- Multiplication (A x B)
- Transpose of Matrix A
- Transpose of Matrix B
- Determinant of Matrix A
- Determinant of Matrix B

## Requirements
Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Application
```bash
python matrix_tool.py
```

## Input Format
Matrix values should be space-separated.
Each new row should be on a new line.

Example:

Matrix A:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
```

Matrix B:
```
7 8 9
1 2 3
```

## Output
Results are displayed in a structured matrix format in the result box.
